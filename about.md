The Université de Montréal structural biology platform offers to academic and industrial researchers the possibility to access the following techniques and equipments:

* Three <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/nmr">NMR spectrometers</a>, including a 700 MHz magnet and 600 MHz magnet equiped with a cryo-probe.
* A <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/saxs">Bio-SAXS instrument</a> powered by a galllium rich alloy metal-jet X-ray source, with automated sample loading capable of high-throughput screening.
* SEC-MALS
* Computers

In addition, several other instruments design to study the biophysical properties of biomolecules are available upon [request](mailto:normand.cyr@umontreal.ca).
